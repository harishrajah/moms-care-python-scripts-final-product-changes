They were involved in the planning and building of the bowls club and other works associated with the grounds. Both had orchards and lived in Valley View Lane, Main Ridge.  Prior to 1926 Main Ridge was known as Main Creek and the name change was brought about by Frank Ditterich.  Seven acres (2.8 hectares) was bought from C. Rigby in 1932 for a recreation ground at Main Ridge for the sum of 50 pounds ($100). A 10 pound ($20) deposit was raised by the community funded in part by a 'sheep guessing competition'. The balance payable over 5 years was raised by community fundraising efforts.
In 1957 the gates were given as a gift by Mrs Lillian Adams of Main Ridge.
On 28th April 1959 the Shire President was invited to unveil a plaque in memory of Frank Ditterich.  Frank was born in Long Gully, Bendigo on 17th September 1895 and died on 28th December 1956 at Mentone. He married his wife Jessie in 1930. They had two sons Richard and David.

By 1905 the reserve was fenced and charges were made for entry, half the proceeds going towards improvements.  It was listed among the civic assets by Cr F. Linley in his submission to the Railway Commissioners, noting then that money was being spent on football and cricket at the reserve. A further two acres (.8 hectare) were acquired there in 1948.

Bert did so much valued service, especially for the Park and Cricket Club. He was also a very good golfer. As a General Carrier for many years, he transported fish and other produce to the markets and brought goods back for the farmers and residents.

Mr Donald Baidwyn noted that the park area which was land deemed for recreational use when the developer was given permission to develop the Orchard Circuit/Dunstan Court Estate as part of the planning for that estate, was undeveloped. He called on local residents in the area for their support and organised contact with local councillors to meet with residents at a park BBQ held on the site, which was met with a very positive response. Mr Baldwyn had plans drawn up for submission to council for their approval. The plans were adapted for what the park is now. He collected donations from residents for the purchase of trees/shrubs for the area in addition to what council gave so that the area would be well covered around the outer boundaries. Once these trees were purchased, and the land semi developed by council, he organised a working bee for the planting of these trees and shrubs. He also developed a roster for the watering and care of these plants to assist in their early establishment. To this day, he still tends to the park, inspecting the plants for care and the grassed area to see if it needs watering. The park is much used by families as an area to fly kites, kick the footy, play soccer and football, and is also used by some elderly as a walking area, where they may take a seat when they tire, or to just watch the world go by in a peaceful environment, thanks to his foresight in developing this area.","English","","","5","3","2105","Council","","","","","","","","56-58","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Greater Shepparton City Council ","Yes","Ordinary Council Meeting ","",""

George Gordon McCrae reminisced that 'Bunting and great wicker balls' told what type of vessel was approaching and the port of origin. Marryat's code of signal flags was used to carry news from Williamstown. The advent of the telegraph rendered the flagstaff redundant and operation ceased on 1 October 1857. The signaller's store and dwelling were incorporated into the Flagstaff Observatory. At 130 ft (39.6 m) in height, and with better sight lines of Williams-town and the bay, Flagstaff Hill had been preferred to Batmans Hill as the observatory site. The Flagstaff Gardens were planted on the site in the 1860s.","","","","","","","Website","Judy Macdonald","","","7","2008","","","","","","","","","","","The University of Melbourne","Flagstaff Hill","eMelbourne","http://www.emelbourne.net.au/biogs/EM00580b.htm","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In 2005 it is one of the most visited and widely used parks in the city by nearby office workers and tourists. The gardens are notable for their archaeological, horticultural, historical and social significance to the history of Melbourne. The gardens are 7.2 hectares (18 acres) of Crown Land bounded by William, La Trobe, King and Dudley streets, managed by the City of Melbourne. On the south-east corner opposite is the entrance to Flagstaff railway station. Diagonally opposite stands the Victorian branch of the Royal Mint, established 7 August 1869. The former Royal Mint building is a well-preserved example of Victorian Gold Rush boom-period classical styled architecture. The facade features paired columns with scrolled capitals and the Royal Mint coat-of-arms. On the northeast corner over William Street, is the Queen Victoria Market. The park contains extensive lawns with a variety of mature trees, flowerbeds and wild animals including possums. The southern end is characterised by deciduous trees, while the northern end contains mature eucalypts. Avenues of elms shade pathways along with several large Moreton Bay Fig trees. The north corner contains a bowling lawn, rose beds, flower and shrub beds. Along William Street there are tennis courts, which also double as volleyball, handball and netball courts. Electric barbecues nearby provides a popular site for office parties in December. Scattered about the lawns and gardens are memorials and sculptures that illuminate some of the social significance of the area. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flagstaff_Gardens","","","","","","1862","Website","Wikipedia","","14","6","2012","","","","","","","","","","","Wikipedia","Flagstaff Gardens","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flagstaff_Gardens","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"VIC","KINGSTON CITY","123571","HAROLD CATERSON RESERVE","REGISTERED","PARK","PARK","145.0696667","-37.9504139","122910","Harold Caterson was a member of Moorabbin Rugby Union Football Club's first committee, he was at the initial meeting in December 1964 that agreed to create a rugby club in Moorabbin to commence in season 1965. He was a long-term committee member (in various positions) and club member in the 60s, 70s and 80s and he was key in establishing a home for Moorabbin at Keys. Rd. Additionally, he was involved on the Management Committee of the Victorian Rugby Union over many years.
In the history of the club Harold Caterson and Jack McDavitt stand out as the two most influential club members who founded, developed and built Moorabbin Rugby Club from scratch.
Jack has, appropriately, had the extended clubrooms (originally built in 1978) named in his honour for his contribution to the club. The reserve was renamed in honour of Harold's contribution to the club.

Keys Rd ground was an old rubbish tip that had been filled and covered in a layer of soil. The surface was continually subsiding, in 1965 junior cricket was played on this ground and the oval was found unsuitable for cricket; it was actually a muddy paddock in winter and a corrugated concrete oval in summer. Cricket never returned to this oval.
Harold could see the potential in the Keys Rd Reserve and in 1967 donated the cost of a single car steel garage placed on a concrete slab, which was to become our first changing room/clubroom, and was later known as ""the old tin shed"". It had the nickname of ""Mr. Cat's Cottage"" on a sign above the door.
The following year a small extension was added that held a briquette hot water service and several showers.
As the Club grew over the years, Harold continued to be a committee member and also continued to liaise with Council regarding club matters. Whether it was gaining approval for further extensions to the shed (there were several extensions over the years), ground improvements, a second playing field, flood lighting and eventually Clubrooms were built in 1978.
Harold was the ""go to person"" in regard to Council. He developed a very good relationship with Mayor Bricker, who later became our Patron for many years and over time became one of the Rams strongest supporters.
Gaining significant funding for a sport that was practically unknown in the district, was not easy. The relationship between Harold and Cr. Bricker proved vital on several occasions as the councillor supported funding for the club which otherwise might not have been approved.
That the Rams are based at Keys Road can be put down to Harold's dedication to securing a permanent home for rugby union in Moorabbin.

The club's playing jersey is also a legacy from Harold Caterson's U18 Marlins team.
He was President in 1968 and 1971; Vice President in 1969, 1970 and from 1972 to 1981 inclusive. Ordinary Committee Member 1965 to 1967.
Harold was made a Life Member in 1977.
Additionally, he was the Moorabbin club delegate to the Victorian Rugby Union for many years; and he would collate the results and statistics for the VRU weekly magazine each week during the season.
His work with the club, Council and the VRU continued right up to his sudden death in 1981.
It is worth noting that four generations of the Caterson family have been involved in playing and administrating the Moorabbin Rugby Club since its inception in 1965.","English","","","30","1","2018","Book","Ian Ray","Life Member Moorabbin Rugby Club","30","1","2018","Lynda Taylor","NA","NA","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

<br>
<br>Peter Avola lived in Strathewen for 39 years and perished in the Victorian Bushfires of 2009 at the Recreation Reserve. Peter was heavily involved with getting the reserve set up in the early 1980's and, from then on, Peter took on the job of maintaining the oval and surrounding areas. He did this on a voluntary basis for nearly 30 years using his own time, machinery and fuel.
<br>
<br>Council, at its 27 March 2012 meeting, resolved that it approve the naming of the Strathewen Pavilion as the Peter Avola Memorial Pavilion. 
<br>
<br>Following approval of the name by the Registrar of Geographic Names, notice of the registration of the name was published in the Victoria Government Gazette on 17 May 2012 with a subsequent Notice of Corrigendum published on 24 May 2012.","","","","","","2012","Oral","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Nillumbik Shire Council","","","","","","",""

He was stationed there until he moved to Lemnos Island and then was at the landing at Gallipoli. He saw service at Anzac Cove and Cape Helles and was there at the Battle of Lone Pine. He was Mentioned in Despatches for his work here. After the evacuation, he was sent back to Egypt where his unit was re-organised and then moved to France.
Between 1916 and 1918 he served on the Western Front, experiencing all the horrors and heroism of those campaigns. He was a veteran of Pozieres, Bullecourt, Passchendaele, Ypres and Delville Wood. In 1918 he returned home to Lilydale, married, had a family and took up a business running a drapers store in Lilydale's Main Street. He also did community work and achieved an extraordinary amount for that township. His family believed his way of coping with what he saw during the war years was to keep himself busy with community work. He was awarded the MBE for his efforts for that community.

<br>
<br>The Shaw family (Benjamin and Elizabeth) arrived in Dromana in 1875 and established Kangerong Guest House.  Their son Archibald Shaw married Maud McKeown, daughter of James and Catherine McKeown, and started the family connection.  Archibald was elected President of the Flinders Shire Council in 1924. Archibald and Maud raised and educated five children in Dromana (Maurice, Ernest, Archibald, Elizabeth and John).  Maurice was the long-term proprietor of the Shell Service Station in Dromana and Shaw's Motors on Nepean Highway for many years prior to his death in 1991 aged 87.  
<br>
<br>The McKeown family (James and Catherine) arrived in Dromana in 1864.  James cut timber for the Dromana pier in 1874 and in 1889 bought Gracefield and land to the East, where they planted an apple orchard.  That land covered the area on which the reserve is now located.  From 1889 to 1891 they were caretakers at Heronswood and in 1892 the McKeowns built Aringa Guest House (Cnr of Clarendon and Foote Streets Dromana) which was managed by their daughters for over 70 years until after the Second World War. James and Catherine raised 12 children (five sons and seven daughters); one daughter, Edith, the source for the naming of Edith Place, died in Dromana in 1987 aged 100. Two further generations of the Shaw and McKeown families have since lived in Dromana.
<br>
<br>The surrounding land and the land on which the reserve is located was subdivided by the descendants of the pioneering Shaws and McKeowns in 1977 and the reserve was transferred to the Shire of Flinders (and since Mornington Peninsula Shire) for use as public open space.","","","","","","","Book","McLear, Colin","A Dreamtime of Dromana","8","4","2006","Dromana and District Historical Society Inc","Dromana","86-88","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The land that comprises Kooyong Park is owned by Council after the Malvern Council purchased the land in 1925-1926. Our research has found that the name of the Park is first raised in Council annual reports in 1931-32 when the curator reported he had planted trees there during the year. Apart from his residency of Stonnington it is noted that Sir Zelman Cowen also had national and international credentials and achievements.","not recorded","","","30","8","2012","Journal","City of Stonnington","Trim 12/62781","","","","","","All","","","Trim 12/62781","9/2012","2012","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
